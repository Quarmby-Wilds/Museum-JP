                    <h3>Welcome to the Hidden Histories of Japan Museum</h3>
                    <h4>Unearthing the stories beneath the surface.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Across Japan's islands lie traces of lives that shaped — and reshaped — the nation's identity. The Hidden Histories of Japan Museum explores the archaeology and anthropology of communities whose stories have too often been buried: the Ainu of the north, the Ryukyuans of the south, and generations of farmers, fishers, artisans, and believers who left their mark in clay, stone, and memory. Step inside a museum where the past is not silent — it speaks through the hands that built, the voices that endured, and the earth that remembers.
